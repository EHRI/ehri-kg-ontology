The EHRI Ontology extends some of the RiC-O types and foremostly adds new properties to represent all the data present in the EHRI Portal. Whenever a class is extended with new properties, a subclass bounded to the ehri prefix is created in order to preserve the original RiC-O axioms intact. In other cases, some classes are specialised and therefore subclasses contribute additional meaning to the superclass. Figure 2 provides a high-level representation of the ontology, including the dependencies between RiC-O classes and the EHRI Ontology ones.

The <a href="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/">EHRI Portal</a> is an aggregator for descriptions of archival material relating to the Holocaust, based around International Council on Archives (ICA) conceptual models such as [<cite><a class="bibref" href="#bib-isad-g">ISAD(G)</a></cite>], [<cite><a class="bibref" href="#bib-isaar-cpf">ISAAR (CPF)</a></cite>] and [<cite><a class="bibref" href="#bib-isdiah">ISDIAH</a></cite>], with some adaptations to cater to its specific use case (see the EHRI Portal data model in Figure 1).

With the release of [<cite><a class="bibref" href="#bib-ric-o">RiC-O</a></cite>], EHRI is seeking to explore the benefits this new model can bring to both the EHRI Portal and collection-holding institutions alike [<cite><a class="bibref" href="#bib-ehri-kg">EHRI-KG</a></cite>]. This ontology is an adaptation of EHRI's existing data model to RiC-O axioms, including attributes derived from the aforementioned conceptual models, with the aim of enabling a more straightforward translation from those widely-adopted standards.

The EHRI Ontology extends a number of RiC-O types, largely with the purpose of adding new properties for attributes used by entities in the EHRI Portal. Whenever a class is extended with new properties, a subclass bounded to the ehri prefix is created in order to preserve the original RiC-O axioms intact. In other cases, some classes are specialised and therefore subclasses contribute additional meaning to the superclass. Figure 2 provides a high-level representation of the ontology, including the dependencies between RiC-O classes and the EHRI derivatives.

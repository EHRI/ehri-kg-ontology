<span class="markdown">The EHRI Ontology extends some of the RiC-O types and foremostly adds new properties to represent all the data present in the EHRI Portal. Whenever a class is extended with new properties, a subclass bounded to the ehri prefix is created in order to preserve the original RiC-O axioms intact. In other cases, some classes are specialised and subclasses add more meaning to the superclass.</span>
